        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Not all recipes have names. Sometimes you just throw a bunch of stuff together, and eat it without even considering what
        it would, or should, be called, which is not a problem unless you also film the dish and plan to post it online. It's
        this exact set of circumstances that led to a little something called "Golden Chicken." Oh yeah, with a name like Golden
        Chicken, you know it's got to be good. Or at least golden. And this is both.</p>
        
       <p> This started out as a quick and dirty curry. But after everything was simmering in the pan, it started to remind me of a
        tagine, as well as (thanks to the "Holy Trinity") some sort of creole-ish chicken stew. Combining all those words into a
        recipe name seemed too hard, so I simply called it what it looked like. So that covers the almost literal meaning, but
        the name also worked figuratively, at least according to a cook I used to work with in college.</p>

    <h2>Ingredient Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 4 (12 ounce) chicken leg quarters</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

        <li>½ cup diced jalapeño pepper</li>

        <li> 2 teaspoons ground cumin </li>
    </ul>




    <li>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
    </li>
    <p>Place chicken leg quarters on a work surface with the skin facing up. Make a cut into the thickest part of each
        drumstick, all the way down to the bone. Then make two cuts, about 1 inch apart, right in the center of each thigh.
        Season both sides generously with 2 teaspoons kosher salt.</p>
    <li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
    </li>
    <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add chicken, skin-side down, and sear until skin is nicely browned, 5 to
        6
        minutes. Flip and sear for 2 more minutes. Turn off the heat and remove chicken to a plate, leaving any rendered fat
        in
        the skillet.</p>
    <li><h4>Step 3</h4></li>
    <p>Turn the heat back on to medium; add onion, celery, jalapeño, and a pinch of salt to the skillet. Sauté until onion
        turns translucent and veggies have softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add cumin, paprika, coriander, turmeric, pepper,
        cayenne,
        cinnamon, and garlic; cook and stir until garlic has cooked a bit and spices are toasted, about 2 minutes.</p>
    <li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
    </li>
    <p>Add chicken to the skillet, skin-side up, and reduce heat to low. Baste chicken with the liquid. Cover and cook over
        low
        or medium-low heat at a gentle simmer for 1 hour.</p>
